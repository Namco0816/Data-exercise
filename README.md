# Data-exercise

This is a super mini-project repo of the data processing and machine learing.

The calculation of the ***GINI index*** and ***infomation gain***, see the [GINI INDEX and INFO GAIN](https://github.com/Namco0816/Data-exercise/blob/master/Decision_Tree_GINI_Info_Gain/Assignment_1_Problem2.ipynb)

Some exercise of the pandas and visualization of the data, see [PANDAS and Visualization](https://github.com/Namco0816/Data-exercise/blob/master/Decision_Tree_GINI_Info_Gain/Assignment_1.ipynb)

Things about ***Decision Tree***, see [DECISION TREE](https://github.com/Namco0816/Data-exercise/blob/master/Decision_Tree_GINI_Info_Gain/Decision_Tree.ipynb)

Some notes and calcution of the ***Bayesian Belief Network*** and ***Naive Bayesian***, see [BBN and Naive Bayesian](https://github.com/Namco0816/Data-exercise/tree/master/bayesian_belief_network_and_naive_bayesian)

The HMM(dynamic planning, Viterbi) and the markov chain solution of the Cpg island, see [MARKOV](https://github.com/Namco0816/Data-exercise/tree/master/markov)

The ANN solution of the MNIST dataset, see [PYTORCH IMPLEMENTATION of ANN](https://github.com/Namco0816/Data-exercise/tree/master/mnist)
